Simple Bouncing Lines Live Wallpaper
====================================

A simple Live Wallpaper with a series of lines that have points bouncing off of the screen.

It originally started off as an inspiration to create a basic screen saver using QBasic, then I thought about how to implement it as live wallpaper for Andoid.

TODOs or Nice To Haves
----------------------
The following items needs work (order from highest to lowest priority):

1. Fix the uneven echo spacing issue when changing the point direction.
2. Consider adding in the option to set the minimum and maximum color values.
3. Find a way to preserve the polygon(s) when the screen surface dimensions change (instead of creating new polygon(s)).
4. Some refactoring in the code to make it more testable.
5. Add unit tests to ensure the engine is working as it should.
