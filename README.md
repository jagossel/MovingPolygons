Simple Bouncing Lines Live Wallpaper
====================================

A simple Live Wallpaper with a series of lines that have points bouncing off of the screen.

It originally started off as an inspiration to create a basic screen saver using QBasic, then I thought about how to implement it as live wallpaper for Andoid.

TODOs
=====
1. Add echos of the same polygon.
2. Apply a changing of color on the polygons.
