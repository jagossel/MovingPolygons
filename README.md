Simple Bouncing Lines Live Wallpaper
====================================

A simple Live Wallpaper with a series of lines that have points bouncing off of the screen.

It originally started off as an inspiration to create a basic screen saver using QBasic, then I thought about how to implement it as live wallpaper for Andoid.

TODOs
-----
1. Some rafctoring in the code to make it more testable.
2. Add in an option to set the delay between frames.
3. Consider adding in the option to set the minimum and maximum color values.
