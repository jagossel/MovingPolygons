Simple Bouncing Lines Live Wallpaper
====================================

A simple Live Wallpaper with a series of lines that have points bouncing off of the screen.

It originally started off as an inspiration to create a basic screen saver using QBasic, then I thought about how to implement it as live wallpaper for Andoid.

TODOs
=====
1. Add different types of color managers: static, triangle wave, and sine wave.
2. Refactor the engine to have centeralized manages instead of it being shared in different classes.
3. Add a prefernces activity to allow the user customize their live wallpaper.
